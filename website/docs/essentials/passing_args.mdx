title: Passing arguments to your requests (WIP)

import noArgProvider from "./passing_args/no_arg_provider";

In the previous article, we saw how we could define a "provider" to make
a simple _GET_ HTTP request.  
But often, HTTP requests depend on external parameters.

For example, previously we used the [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/)
to suggest a random activity to users.
But maybe users would want to filter the type of activity they want to do,
or have price requirements, etc...  
These parameters are not known in advance. So we need a way to pass
these parameters from our UI to our providers.

## Updating our providers to accept arguments

As a reminding, previously we defined our provider like this:

<When codegen={false}>

When not relying on code-generation, we need to tweak the syntax for defining
our providers a bit to support passing arguments.  
This is done by relying on what we call a "family" (more about why this name later).

</When>

TODO:

- [ ] Reuse the `FutureProvider` from the previous example
- [ ] Add an argument to filter the category of activity generated
- [ ] Update Consumers to pass the argument to the requests
- [ ] Mention how it is possible to listen to the same provider
      with different arguments simultaneously
- [ ] Note that providers should generally enable "autoDispose" when using
      arguments, to avoid memory leaks
- [ ] Explain why "family" is called this way
- [ ] Mention how it is important for parameters to have consistent equality
  - [ ] Talk about how if you do provider([]) you'll have an infinite rebuild/loading loop
  - [ ] Recommend using riverpod_lint's lint to ensure consistent equality
- [ ] Showcase how using Dart 3 records can allow passing multiple arguments
      without having to create a class
