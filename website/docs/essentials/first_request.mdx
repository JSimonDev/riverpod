TODO:

- [ ] Make sure `ProviderScope` is added at the root of the application
  - Do not add it to `MaterialApp`, but straight up as parameter to `runApp`
- [ ] Define a `FutureProvider`
  - This could fetch the bored API to return a random activity
- [ ] Consume the `FutureProvider` inside a Consumer
- [ ] Handle Loading/Error states
- [ ] Mention how the `FutureProvider` is cached by default
